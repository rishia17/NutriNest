# (Team-45) Nutri Nest
Nutri Nest is a project developed during a 36-hour hackathon, where we focused on creating an intuitive platform to help users track and improve their nutritional intake. The website features the following functionalities:

1).Food Nutrient Detection: Users can upload an image of food, and the system identifies the nutrients present using advanced image processing techniques.

2).Interactive Dashboard: Based on the user's BMI score, the website displays a personalized dashboard showing relevant information and suggestions for a healthier lifestyle.

3).Chatbot Assistance: Nutri Nest includes a chatbot that accepts both text and speech inputs. The chatbot assists users by answering queries and providing nutritional advice.

These features are powered by the Gemin API, which enables efficient nutrient identification and personalized health recommendations.
